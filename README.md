# StreamBrew

StreamBrew is a Bun/TypeScript and Go monorepo for a streaming dashboard. The
TanStack Start web application uses tRPC and PostgreSQL; separate Go services
collect chat and donations and turn supported links from donation messages into
videos. Production is available at [streambrew.app](https://streambrew.app).

Project tasks are managed with [just](https://just.systems/). Run `just` to
list them.

## GitHub automation

The `Translate Russian issues` workflow translates newly opened Russian Issues
to English with the OpenAI API and adds the original Russian title and
description as a comment. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY__TRANSLATE` as a repository
Actions secret before enabling the workflow. The key is used only by that
workflow and is not written to its logs.

## Development prerequisites

Install these tools on the host:

- [Bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation) for the TypeScript workspace;
- Go 1.27.1, as declared by `go.mod`, for the Go services;
- [just](https://just.systems/) for repository tasks;
- Docker with the Compose plugin for PostgreSQL and NATS;
- PostgreSQL 18 client tools for `pg_dump`;
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for the Go lint task;
- [sqruff](https://github.com/quarylabs/sqruff) 0.40.0 for SQL formatting and linting.

`just install` installs workspace tools such as `dotenvx` and `dbmate`; they do not need a
separate global installation. `cloc` is only needed for the optional
`just count-lines` task. Keep the PostgreSQL client version at least as new as
the database server so `dbmate` can refresh the schema dump.

## Start locally

The tracked `.env.dev` is the encrypted source for development settings. Obtain
the matching, untracked `.env.keys` file before initializing the environment.
Then run:

```sh
just install
just env-init
just dev-db-up
just db-migrate
just dev
```

Database changes live in `db/migrations`. Create one with
`just db-migration-new <name>`, write its up and down SQL, and run
`just db-migrate`. Use `just db-migration-status` to inspect pending migrations.
Successful migrations automatically refresh the tracked `db/schema.sql` dump;
`just db-dump` refreshes it without running migrations. Run `just fmt-sql` after
either command to format both the dump and migrations with sqruff.
Formatting also removes SQL comments other than dbmate migration directives.
The initial migration recognizes databases created before versioned migrations
and records their existing schema as its baseline.

The environment and development infrastructure scripts are written in TypeScript, live in `scripts/`,
and run through Bun Shell. `just typecheck-scripts` checks their types and is included in `just typecheck`.

`just env-init` decrypts `.env.dev` into the gitignored `.env` file. All
worktrees share one repository-wide PostgreSQL and NATS Compose stack, while
each worktree receives its own application and service ports, PostgreSQL
database, and NATS namespace. The Compose project name and infrastructure ports
are derived from the common Git directory, not the individual worktree folder.
If the shared containers already run under a different Compose project name,
save that name with `git config --local streambrew.devComposeProject <existing-name>`
and run `just env-init` in each worktree that needs to use them. This local Git
setting is shared across worktrees and preserves the existing containers and
volumes; their published PostgreSQL and NATS ports must match the generated ports.
Local PostgreSQL connections use `PGSSLMODE=disable`.
`just dev-db-up` starts the shared infrastructure
when necessary and creates the current worktree's database. `just dev` starts
the web, chat, donations, and video processes.

`just test-env-init` checks the environment recipe across temporary Git worktrees
without Docker or development credentials. It also runs as part of `just test`.

The local application URL is the `APP_DOMAIN` value written to `.env`.
Authentication and the web UI use that origin, and `/api/chat/*` is handled by
the web application before permitted requests are forwarded to the chat
service.

T3 Code's setup action in `t3.json` runs
`just t3-worktree-init "$T3CODE_PROJECT_ROOT"`. It copies `.env.keys` from the
primary checkout, initializes the worktree environment, installs dependencies,
starts the shared development infrastructure, creates and copies the
worktree's database from the primary checkout, and applies pending migrations. The same
recipe can be run manually with the source worktree path. The source worktree must have an
initialized `.env` and a running development PostgreSQL container; a copy
failure stops setup. Run `just dev` after the worktree is ready to start the
application processes.

Periodically clean up completed worktrees from the primary checkout with:

```sh
just dev-cleanup
```

The cleanup scripts live in `scripts/` and run through Bun Shell.
The command requires confirmation. It removes every secondary worktree whose
working tree is clean and whose `HEAD` is already merged into the primary
branch, then deletes its local branch. It also removes every secondary or
orphaned `streambrew_*` development database and `wt_*` NATS namespace while
preserving the primary checkout's database, NATS namespace, and the shared
infrastructure data. If the shared containers were stopped, cleanup starts them
temporarily and stops them again afterward. If any worktree is dirty, locked,
or unmerged, cleanup stops before removing anything. There is no per-session
cleanup step.

`just dev-infra-down` stops the shared containers while retaining all data;
`just dev-infra-destroy` removes the shared volumes and therefore requires
confirmation because it affects every checkout.

## Production

Production runs on Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure. The manual
`AWS infrastructure` workflow manages Lightsail, its firewall and snapshots,
and S3 backups. `Production` builds immutable application and PostgreSQL/WAL-G
images and applies only the portable Docker runtime over SSH, so routine
releases neither plan nor replace cloud resources. Bootstrap, first deployment,
migrations, rollback, networking, and backup guidance lives in
[the deployment guide](docs/deployment.md).

PostgreSQL continuously archives WAL files to the configured S3-compatible
storage, while the `wal-g` service creates and retains periodic base backups.
The production host provides these operational tasks:

```sh
just backup-now
just backup-list
just backup-verify
```

A successful upload or verification command is not a restore test. Regularly
test recovery into a separate empty volume before relying on the backups.
